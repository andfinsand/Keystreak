# Keystreak

Created in Pygame.

- Count consecutive keystrokes to assess typing accuracy.
- Longest streak..
- Previous streak. 
- Counter resets when Backspace button pressed. 

Roadmap:

- Specify keystrokes to letters, numbers, spacebar, and return key.
- Add prompt paragraph user will type out. 
- Add spellchecker.
- Add timer (starts on first keystroke and ends when Return key pressed) with calculated words per minute (WPM).
